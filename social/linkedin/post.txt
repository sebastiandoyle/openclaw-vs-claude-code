I spent the weekend going deep on two very different approaches to AI assistants.

OpenClaw (157K GitHub stars, formerly Clawdbot) is an always-on personal AI that reaches you on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord. It has a soul file. It works while you sleep.

Claude Code (by Anthropic) is an on-demand coding agent in your terminal. Purpose-built for software engineering. No personality. Pure execution.

Both are powerful. Neither replaces the other.

I built an interactive learning experience that breaks down both tools through architecture diagrams, code walkthroughs, quizzes, and hands-on exercises.

30 minutes. Evidence-based learning science. Completely free.

Built with Claude Code, naturally.
